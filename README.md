# Distracted_Driver
There is a growing problem of driver distraction resulting in accidents, there is an opportunity to identify real time driver distraction that can trigger warning, alerts or actionable task to avoid accidents. Warnings may range from alerting the driver to other mitigating steps like initiating deceleration or soft braking.
Â 
This approach suggests a method to detect and classify visual distraction. It will adopt convolution neural networks and other machine learning classification models to construct distraction detection models. Data for training and testing the models have been collected from the Kaggle site and will be used to classify distracted driver behavior.

There are in total 22424 Training Images. The image size is 640x480x3. There are in total 10 classes and approximately 2240 images in each class. There are 26 unique drivers performing 10 different actions.

For our initial analysis we selected a subset of the original data containing 11400 images across 5 categories.
c0: safe driving
c1: texting - right
c2: talking on the phone - right
c3: texting - left
c4: talking on the phone - left

To bring down the processing time, we pre-processed the input images to scale down the resolution and colors
Dimension from 640*640 to 224*224
Color from RGB to Gray Scale

To normalize the data, we divided each pixel with 255 so that we can have uniformly distributed values ranging from [0-1]
